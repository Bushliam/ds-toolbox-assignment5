# "Definition: git status"
The git status command is useful in Git for providing information about the current state of the repository. Here's what it does:

1. Shows Untracked, Modified, and Staged Files: It lists all untracked, modified, and staged files in the working directory and the staging area. This helps you understand which files have been changed since the last commit and which changes are staged for the next commit.

2. Indicates Branch Status: It displays the name of the current branch and whether it's up to date with the remote branch, ahead, or behind. This helps you keep track of your progress and whether you need to push or pull changes.

3. Provides guidance on steps to fix problems by suggesting the commands you can run based on the current state of the repository.

You can also access information provided by git status in JupyterLab IDE:

1. File Browser: JupyterLab's file browser provides visual indicators for file status. Modified files may be highlighted or marked differently from unmodified files. Additionally, untracked files may appear in a different color or with a specific icon.

2. Git Extension: JupyterLab has Git integration through the extension. This extension usually includes a Git tab or sidebar panel that displays repository status. It shows modified, untracked, and staged files, similar to the output of git status in the terminal.
